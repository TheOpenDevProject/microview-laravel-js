# microview-laravel-js
A micro framework for building applications based on laravels routing system.

## Why?
This is actually part of a much larger closed source project I am working on. This is the foundation for many of the widgets that exist.

## Why not ReactJS?
React is complex and often overkill, MicroView can be integrated with React if you want.
